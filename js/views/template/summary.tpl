            My name is Yong Guan. I'm a full stack software developer with 9 years of industrial experience. I primarily work with .NET Framework and JavaScript. Writing code for front-end UI, middle tiers, REST services, and SQL databases have been my daily routines.
            <p>
            I have been building enterprise web applications with .NET and JavaScript since 2006, from ASP.NET applications to single page applications with Backbone and Ext JS. Moreover, since 2011, I have also been writing automated tests for the whole stack, such as, C# unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end service tests, Selenium tests, and JavaScript unit tests.

                I'm an innovator who are into improving productivity, and I have prototyped frameworks that can simplify test code development and speed up test runtime.

            <p>
            I'm an active learner of technology. Besides reading a lot of technology books and blog posts, I have been trying them out by building simple applications with D3.js, Angular.js, paper.js, Node.js, Google Dart, Ruby, and Python, and you can see some of them from my <a href="https://www.github.com/yguan" target="_blank">github account</a>.

            <p>
            My recent learning passion is in talen acquisition and retention, innovation, productivity improvement, software architecture, machine learning, D3.js, visual thinking, and ways to increase our learning speed.

            While I'm not reading books or writing code, I may be dancing salsa or swing.
