        My name is Yong Guan. I'm a full stack software developer with almost 8 years of industrial experience. I primarily work with .NET Framework and JavaScript. Writing SQL, middle tiers, REST services, and front-end UI have been parts of my daily routines.
        <p>
        I have been building enterprise web applications with .NET and JavaScript since 2006, from ASP.NET applications to single page applications with Backbone and Ext JS. Moreover, since 2011, I have also been writing automated tests for the whole stack, such as, C# unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end service tests, Selenium tests, and JavaScript unit tests.

        I'm an active learner of technology. Besides reading a lot of technology books and blog posts, I have been trying them out by building simple applications with D3.js, Angular.js, paper.js, Node.js, Google Dart, Ruby, and Python, and you can see some of them from my <a href="https://www.github.com/yguan" target="_blank">github account</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        My recent learning passion is in machine learning, D3.js, visual thinking, and ways to increase our learning speed.

        While I'm not reading books or writing code, I may be dancing salsa or swing.
