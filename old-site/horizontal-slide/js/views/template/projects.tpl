        <h4>Flex Note
            <a href="https://github.com/yguan/notepad" target="_blank"><span class="github"></span></a>
        </h4>
        It's a note taking app that allows you to customize the layout the way you want. You can <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/flex-note/acndffknklaklnnpjmdbfknnohmikcje" target="_blank">download the Chrome App</a> from the Chrome Web Store, or you can run directly from demo site. The only problem with the demo site is that you can lose all your note if you clear your browser's cache data.

        <h4>Test Anywhere
            <a href="https://github.com/yguan/test-anywhere" target="_blank"><span class="github"></span></a>
        </h4>
        I have been trying to convince people that automated end-to-end testing on a website should be done with JavaScript that can be run on a browser, because it's easier to write, debug, and maintain. And yet, people always have an excuse of not trying it out. So I built this test runner that can be loaded into any website (except https), and run mocha tests on it. Hopefully this will get people thinking about it.
        <p>Moreover, my <a href="https://github.com/yguan/mocha_webdriver_tests" target="_blank">mocha_webdriver_tests</a> repository contains code that can start a browser session with Webdriver, and then inject test scripts into to the session. However, more work needs to be done to get it to the production level. If you're interested on using or working on the projects, let me know. I will be really happy to see them being used.</p>
        <p>I also managed to get Ace Editor working as part of the script injection. Ace Editor has really nice feature, but it's code is not ready to be packed by require.js yet. If you want to know how it is being done, let me know.</p>

        <h4>Windows 8 Style Dashboard
            <a href="https://github.com/yguan/dashboard" target="_blank"><span class="github"></span></a>
        </h4>
        I was intrigued by the Windows 8 Dashboard and wondered if I could build something like that. After finding out gridster,the whole thing became so easy. Combining it with a carousel and the basic functionality is here. Bootstrap 3 is nice to be an add-on as well.

        <h4>Portfolio Site
            <a href="https://github.com/yguan/portfolio-site" target="_blank"><span class="github"></span></a>
        </h4>
        This is my portfolio site that you're looking at right now. It's built with require.js, jQuery, and D3.js. It's aim to replace the boring paper resume and make the presentation of who I am more informative and fun.

        <h4>D3.js Playground
        <a href="https://github.com/yguan/d3-playground" target="_blank"><span class="github"></span></a>
        </h4>
        As I learn about D3.js, reusable chart classes are created, and eventually something good will arrive.

        <h4>Bookmark Tagging
        <a href="https://github.com/yguan/bookmark-tagging" target="_blank"><span class="github"></span></a>
        </h4>
        This is a Chrome extension that allows you to manage your bookmarks with tags instead of folders. The Web version has some missing functionality due to the security permission in Chrome. If you like the demo, you can <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmarks-tagging/kmdepbjjhlbhohppiancfgdpkjcoajgb?hl=en" target="_blank">download the extension</a> from the Chrome Web Store.
