## Overview

This article proposes a way to mock the Web server so that the client-side code can be tested with a server as close as the real Web server without the slowness of the actual Web server.

The client-side code discussed here will the JavaScript running in a browser.


## The Problems

### Automated user acceptance tests implemented with Selenium are slow.

Automated tests written with Selenium to drive a browser to test the application is slow because the tests trigger the whole stacks to be executed, which usually involves making http requests, calling database, and executing business and domain layer codes.

### Client-side code unit testing involves a lot of mockings and usually lacks of coverage from the integration perspective.

Well-structure client-side code may be easy to test with mocks, but mocks are usually not managed well. As more tests are ceated, mocks become messy, and changing of mocks can be time-consuming if  people are not the ones that implemneted the mocks.

Even if mocking for unit tests is not a problem, mocking for integration tests is still a nightmare, because so many ajax calls have to be mocked so that the application can reach to the state that can be tested.

## The Proposed Solution

### Solution

Create a test server that can handle all the requests made by the client-side code, and configure the client-side code to call the test server instead of the actual Web server.

The test server acts similar to a cache server of the actual server, and it has two modes:  active and passive.

**Active mode** is for the integration server to run tests periodically, and has the following capabilities:

1. It stores each http request it receives in a database and use the request as the primary key of a record.
2. For each request it receives, it will search the database for the response data. If the request doesn't exist, it will make a request to the actual server, and store the reponse data from the actual server to the database with request as a key.
3. It returns the response data to a request after it finds the data in the database or receives the data from the actual server.
4. It supports automatic update of response data by making http request to the Web server with the requests stored in the test server's database, and it will creates a report to show the differences of response data between the data in the database and from the test server.
5. It provides API to insert and update response data for a request.
6. It provides API to clear all data.

Note: items 4 to 6 are not implemented in the [Test Server](https://github.com/yguan/test-server) repository.

**Passive mode** is for people to run while writing tests. It has all the capabilities of active mode except it always forward requests to the actual server and updates the database with the latest responses from the actual server. It also stores any new requests (without response data) to a separate database/collection, so that the requests can be used to update the test server's database in the integration server.

### Sequence Diagrams

Here are two sequence diagrams that depict the interactions between components for different scenarios in **active mode**.

### Benefits

1. In active mode, it makes the user acceptance tests run a lot faster. After the database has stored the reponse data, A response from the test sever will be really fast because it will be just a lookup in the database to get the correct response data.
2. It indirectly test the actual server when the test server update its response data by sendings requests to the actual server.
3. It eliminates the need to write mocks when writing integration tests for client-side code.
4. It can be used to implement certain randomized behaviors to mimic sever overload or failure situations.


## The Implementation

### Technology to Use

* Proxy Server - [hoxy](http://greim.github.io/hoxy/)
* Database - [tingodb](http://www.tingodb.com/) (data is stored in text files as JSON.)
* Fake Real Server - [restify](http://mcavage.me/node-restify/)
* Http Client for Testing - [unirest](http://unirest.io/nodejs.html)

### Github Repository

The source code of the test server that is hosted [here](https://github.com/yguan/test-server). It is simple enough to demonstrate the ideas mentioned in this article, and it can easily be extended for other purpose as well.


## Issues

### Cross-domain Requests

If the client-side code is fetched from a domain different from the ajax call made in the client-side, the [same-origin policy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy) may kick in and cause the ajax call failed. If the server [enables cross-origin resource sharing](http://enable-cors.org/), this may not be a problem. However, it seems to be really difficult to enable cross-origin resource sharing for localhost in IIS. If you encounter this problem, you can set up the server environment as the following sequence diagram. The browser connects to the test server to get everything, including resource files (js, css, images, and so on). The drawback of this approach is performance, because every single request has to go through the test server.

## Conclusion

Even though this article focues on building a test server to make UI automation tests run faster. The same test server can be repurposed to act as a recording server, which will allow us easily turn it into a performance/load testing tool. It seem there are a lot of possibilities for the use of the test server idea, and I wish you can spread my article to people you know, and hopefully people will get inspired and create more useful things.
