The Web version has some missing functionality due to the security permission in Chrome. If you like the demo, you can [download the extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmarks-tagging/kmdepbjjhlbhohppiancfgdpkjcoajgb?hl=en) from the Chrome Web Store.\r\n\r\n[![Image](image/bookmark-tagging.png?raw=true)](bookmark-tagging/index.html)\r\n\r\n#### Hack Day JS Projects in 2012\r\n\r\nThis is a showcase for some of the JavaScript projects I did on the once-a-month hack days while I was at Daptiv.\r\n\r\n[![Image](image/bookmark-tagging.png?raw=true)](hackday-js/index.html)","google":"UA-44790269-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
